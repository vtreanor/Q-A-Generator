# Q&A Generator

## Generates a static web page from a json file of questions and answers

The web page is generated by the python script gen.py. It functions as follows:

- Reads in header.html and outputs it to index.html

- Reads in TheoryTest.json. It iterates over all question and answer entries and generates appropriate html divs for each and appends to index.html

- Reads in footer.html and appends it to index.html

Thats it, index.html is now a complete static web page.

Finally index.html is uploaded to AWS S3 as a static web page.
